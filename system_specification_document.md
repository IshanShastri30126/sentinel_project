# SENTINAL — Comprehensive System Specification & Architecture Document

This document provides a detailed technical specification of the **SENTINAL** digital operations platform. It covers the system architecture, design tokens, frontend routes, form validation animations, backend REST API routes, Prisma PostgreSQL models, and analytical reporting features.

---

## 1. Executive Summary & Design Aesthetics

**SENTINAL** is a centralized operational command center designed for technical cybersecurity clubs. It facilitates real-time event coordination, team formation, automated attendance tracking via QR-telemetry, cryptographic certificate generation, gamified member leaderboard tracking, multi-level hierarchy approvals, and public landing page administration.

### Design Paradigm: SpaceX Cybersecurity Theme
The entire interface is built using a dark-mode theme utilizing high-contrast, premium accents matching aerospace dashboards:
* **Background Color**: `#05070A` (Near Black Deep Space)
* **Accent Colors**: 
  * `Neon Lime (#CCFF00)` — Primary indicators, verified status, active links, and checkout points.
  * `Burn Orange (#FF4D00)` — Secondary alerts, pending approvals, timeline milestones, and actions.
  * `Hot Red (#FF003C)` — Security errors, access denial warning banners, and deactivation toggles.
  * `Dark Slate / Charcoal (#0D0F14)` — Primary card bodies and interactive controls.
* **Layout Grid**: 12-column responsive flex layouts, monospaced metadata labels, glowing corner indicators, scanline animations, and clean, non-overlapping layouts optimized for density and readability.

## 2. System Architecture Overview

SENTINAL is structured as a decoupled monorepo:
* **Frontend**: Next.js App Router (v16.2.6), Tailwind CSS v4, Framer Motion for animations, and Lucide React icons.
* **Backend**: Node.js Express server configured with TypeScript (tsc), Prisma client, JWT authentication, and local multer upload streaming.
* **Database**: PostgreSQL storing users, events, check-ins, certificates, gamification logs, notifications, and club settings.

## 6. Analytical Reports Engine

The reporting core operates by dynamically parsing relational PostgreSQL records:

### 6.1. Registration Growth Timeline Report
* **Calculation**: Aggregates `createdAt` timestamps from `EventRegistration` group-by dates.
* **Visualization**: Rendered on the client as a sequential bar chart. The chart width scale is relative to the peak registration volume day:
  $$\text{Bar Width \%} = \left(\frac{\text{Registrations on Date}}{\text{Max Registrations in Single Day}}\right) \times 100$$
* **SpaceX Color Styling**: Lime-orange progress gradients with monospaced numerical offsets.

### 6.2. Team Size Distribution Report
* **Calculation**: Resolves team counts by aggregating `TeamMember` counts linked to each unique team.
* **Visualization**: Grouped categories (e.g. "2 members", "3 members"). Styled with red-orange progress bars for rapid diagnostic view.

### 6.3. Check-In & Attendance Telemetry Report
* **Calculation**: Computes three core ratios from the `Attendance` table:
  1. **Checked In**: Distinct users with a `CHECK_IN` record.
  2. **Checked Out**: Distinct users with a matching `CHECK_OUT` record.
  3. **Late Arrivals**: Scans where `timestamp` exceeds the event's `startDate`.
* **Visualization**: HUD summary cards with lime green check marks and telemetry alerts.
